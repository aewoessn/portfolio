# Welcome to my portfolio page! 📖
Within this folder is assorted code and documentation snippets for anyone interested in my programming style. <br />
**WARNING: This code is highly specific and strongly affiliated with the [Quinn Lab](https://kpquinn.hosted.uark.edu). Any code within or linked to in this folder _will not_ run without the proper context and is intended only for demonstration purposes.**

# Table of contents (with brief descriptions)
- 📁Matlab documentation
  - An easily scalable approach to consistently document matlab functions which integrates with matlab's help documentation.
- 📜stackShow.m
  - This matlab function, which has gone through a few arduous iterations, renders 3D image volumes.
- 📜green2D.m
  - The purpose of this matlab function is to perform isoparametric mapping for 2D triangles or squares to directly calculate deformation based on continuum mechanics.
- 📜imageStitch.m
  - The purpose of this matlab function is to stitch a sequence of images together, as well as blend the seams by using a distance-weighted approach.
- 📜xml2imagedata.m
  - The purpose of this matlab function is to extract metadata information from a ".xml" file, which is important for correctly normalizing multiphoton images.

# Interested in seeing some python code?
Here are three locations to look at (from most to least accessible):
- 📁[Outreach program](https://github.com/aewoessn/outreach-program-2021)
  - An outreach program that was intended for high school-level education of image analysis and deep learning using PyTorch.
- 📁[BIOL5153](https://github.com/aewoessn/BIOL5153)
  - Coursework done for BIOL5153 (Programming for Biologists) at the University of Arkansas. 
- 📁[QPyLI](https://github.com/aewoessn/QPyLI)
  - Course project for BIOL5153 which combined camera hardware, additional rotary stage hardware, and image acquisition using OpenCV2.

# Other programming languages
I also have experience in performing data visualization and rigorous statistical analysis in R, which can be seen in [this (open access!) publication](https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2021.642866).
Additionally, I have some experience in C++ through early undergraduate coursework.
