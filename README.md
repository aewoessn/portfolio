# Table of contents (with brief descriptions)
- 📁Matlab documentation
  - An easily scalable approach to consistently document matlab functions which integrates with matlab's help documentation.
- 📜stackShow.m
  - This matlab function, which has gone through a few arduous iterations, renders 3D image volumes. Here is an example of one such render: [insert image here]
- 📜green2D.m
  - The purpose of this matlab function is to perform isoparametric mapping for 2D triangles or squares to directly calculate deformation based on continuum mechanics.
- 📜imageStitch.m
  - The purpose of this matlab function is to stitch a sequence of images together, as well as blend the seams by using a distance-weighted approach.
- 📜xml2imagedata.m
  - The purpose of this matlab function is to extract metadata information from a ".xml" file, which is important for correctly normalizing multiphoton images.
